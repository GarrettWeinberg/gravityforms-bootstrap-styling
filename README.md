### Usage

The easiest way to use these styles is to clone them into your theme and integrate them into your build process. They will work out of the box with the [Sage](https://github.com/roots/sage) starter theme and others.

Please use these styles together with these Gravityforms Bootstrap [hooks](https://github.com/MoshCat/gravityforms-bootstrap-hooks) for full functionality.
